## Features üöÄ

* **Clear Explanations:** Easy-to-understand explanations of Big-O notation, time and space complexity, and related concepts.
* **Interactive Complexity Chart:** Visualize the growth of different Big-O complexities with a customizable chart. Choose different chart types, input sizes, and complexities to see how they compare.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms Tables:** Detailed tables listing common data structures and sorting algorithms, along with their best-case, average-case, and worst-case complexities.
* **Real-World Use Cases:** Learn how Big-O applies to real-world scenarios, helping you choose the right data structures and algorithms for your projects.
* **Quiz:** Test your knowledge of Big-O with an interactive quiz featuring different question formats.
* **Additional Resources:**  Links to external articles, videos, and websites to further your understanding.
* **Glossary:** Definitions of key terms used in algorithm analysis.
* **Deeper Concepts:** Explanations of amortized analysis, space-time trade-offs, and the P vs. NP problem.
* **Interview Tips:** Guidance on how to analyze algorithm complexity during technical interviews.
* **Code Examples:**  Python code examples to illustrate common data structures and algorithms. (Future enhancement: add more languages!)
* **Dark/Light Mode:**  Switch between light and dark themes for your preferred viewing experience.
* **Print-Friendly:**  Easily print the cheat sheet for offline reference.
* **Comments Section:** Discuss Big-O concepts and ask questions in the comments section powered by Disqus.
* **YouTube Video Integration:** Explore relevant Big-O videos directly on the site (powered by the YouTube API).
